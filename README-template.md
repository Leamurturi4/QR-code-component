### What I learned

During this project, I improved my skills in styling elements with CSS and using variables for colors. Below is a snippet of the CSS code I used
To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.container {
    background-color: var(--white);
    border-radius: 5%;
    padding: 20px;
    max-width: 320px;
    text-align: center;
    box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}
```

### Continued development

In the future, I would like to add more animations and effects to make the design more dynamic and engaging.
